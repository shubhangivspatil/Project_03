**DS_Airbnb Analysis**
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listing data to derive insights that can help understand the intricacies of the travel and lodging market. It involves several key phases:
1.	Data Retrieval: The first step involves setting up a MongoDB Atlas connection to efficiently retrieve Airbnb data. This process ensures that the large dataset is accessed smoothly for subsequent analysis.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation: Once the data is retrieved, it undergoes thorough cleaning and preparation. This phase addresses common issues such as missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types to ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset. The cleaned data is then ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
3.	Development of a Streamlit Web Application: Using Python and Streamlit, an interactive web application will be developed. This app will feature geospatial visualizations of Airbnb listings, allowing users to interactively explore various factors such as pricing, ratings, and property types across different locations.
4.	Price Analysis: The cleaned data will be used to analyze how listing prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Dynamic plots and charts will be created to visualize these price trends, identify outliers, and explore potential correlations with other variables like location and rating.
5.	Seasonal Availability Analysis: This component focuses on examining the availability of listings across different seasons, aiming to uncover patterns in occupancy rates and booking trends. Visualization techniques such as line charts, heatmaps, or other appropriate methods will be used to represent seasonal demand fluctuations clearly.
6.	Location-Based Insights: By employing MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques, the project will extract insights for specific regions or neighborhoods. These insights will focus on how listing prices vary by location, which will be visualized on interactive maps or integrated into dashboard tools like Tableau or Power BI.
7.	Interactive Visualizations: The project will feature dynamic visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their specific interests. These interactive elements enable a deeper exploration of the data, focusing on specific regions, property types, or time periods.
8.	Dashboard Creation: Finally, using visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI, a comprehensive dashboard will be constructed. This dashboard will combine various visualizations—including maps, charts, and tables—to provide a holistic view of the data and its patterns. This allows stakeholders to quickly grasp key insights and make informed decisions.
